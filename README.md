# Repo for Archived Projects

You can Fork any and all of these and create your own Projects, just as long as you follow these guidelines :

1- Include me & A link back to my Git in README
2- You give your project a new name without "Xero"
3- Add your info in scripts, keeping me at the top...

Enjoy ;)
