Regrettably, due to the departure of key contributors who were instrumental in supporting the Gnome & XFCE spins, we find ourselves in a position where these versions will no longer be actively maintained. However, the source code will remain accessible for those interested in furthering their development. It is essential for me to acknowledge my limitations as a sole entity and to manage expectations accordingly. Thank you for understanding...
